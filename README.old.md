- __Problem Context__: It is difficult to remember all the friends you have across the globe and that could slow down your travel plan.
- __Solution__: A web app that’ll allow you to add your friend and their detail, which will be displayed on the map. This would help in locating your friends in a specific country in which reaching out to them to host you would be much easier.
